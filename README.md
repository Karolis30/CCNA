                 Static routes are manually configured routes that tell a router exactly where to send network traffic for a specific destination. Unlike dynamic routing, which automatically learns routes using protocols like OSPF or EIGRP, static routing requires the network administrator to define each route.

ðŸ”¹ Key Points about Static Routes:

1.Manually configured: You specify the destination network, the next-hop IP address (or exit interface), and optionally, a metric.

2.Used for simple or small networks: Ideal for stable, predictable environments where routes donâ€™t change often.(Small company)

3.No overhead: Since thereâ€™s no protocol exchanging information, static routes use fewer system resources.

4.High control, low flexibility: You have full control, but if the network topology changes, you must update the routes manually.
